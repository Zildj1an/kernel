#LibreOS project :computer:
_please note this project is only for learning purposes_

##why even bother doing this?
  * Learning Purposes:
    * Studying computer science at university, I joined a group of geeks under the name of LibreLabUCM, they helped me materializing my interest in Linux and Free Software development.
    * I know understanding and mastering every aspect of this life (life=linux kernel and computer architecture in general) is close to impossible but why not trying to develop a little kernel just for fun?
  * Sounds great but how do you plan to tackle this project?
    * I picked up a 1300 pages book from the library, _Professional linux kernel architecture, by Wolfgang Maurer_. This book looks like a bible to me and i'm slowly reading it to try to understand the general idea.
    * I'll try to fool my colleages to join this project, and see what can we do together. (Just kidding, any help or recomendation here ll be very helpful)
  * Any particular plan?
    1. Get a little console working
    2. Try to manage memory making it sort of efficient.
    3. Make some rudimentary drivers of basic i/o
    4. Simplest file system ever.
    5. Networking
    6. Everything that could be in this place is a dream right now.

**Its just a big C program, they said...**
